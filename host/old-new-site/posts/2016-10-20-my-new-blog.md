# My new blog is ready

So the day have come. Finally managed to make a small blog "engine" like thing and create a new design because the old one was not that shiny. My plan was to not use Jekyll but still have some dynamic sytem. I will write a post about it soon.

The old site contained the projects i worked on and i am currently working on, but its gone now. So i will include them in this post.

## Projects

### Viveka

Viveka was born as a proof of concept project and aimed to do better visual regression as the currently existing solutions.

The system was designed around a new layer above the perceptual image differencing, achieving it with DOM analyzation.

The project is not longer maintained, but the repository is still available [here](https://github.com/viveka-io/viveka)

### Linden

Linden is visual regression tool based on Viveka (because i think the concept app was a success). However the application design is different, using an other approach and it's we are building it as a console tool instead of a website.

It's available [here](https://github.com/chrisakakay/linden)

I warmly welcome every contributor or anyone who is interested in it.

### OpenRemoteServer

Yes I know it has a bad name. Btw it's a Sublime plugin. Which works like this:

Http server -> accepts file paths as parameters -> opens up files in Sublime

It's great if you want to connect your browser with sublime. Available [here](https://github.com/chrisakakay/OpenRemoteServer)
