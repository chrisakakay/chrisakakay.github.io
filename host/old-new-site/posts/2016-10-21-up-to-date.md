# Up to date with JavaScript

I decided my first post will not be tech related. I mean it won't contain any code, but the topic is heavily tech related. If you missed the post ["How it feels to learn JavaScript in 2016"](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.ac6oep50c) by [Jose Aguinaga](https://twitter.com/jjperezaguinaga), go and read it's. It's a beautiful post about the struggle of a modern day frontend developer. 

I felt myself exactly in the same situation, when in 2015 i tried to make a pet project in my free time and decided to learn something new properly.

First i tried out Angular, started with the standard todo app implementation, but i didn't like it.

Next stop, React. Well, to be honest after i saw JSX, i said NO. Seriously "html" in js? Why?

So i went with jQuery again. It was not that satisfying. I wanted to keep up a but with the current trends. I checked outher libs as well, but nothing was fancy enough to go with it.

Few weeks passed, i started to play with React again with babel-browser (still 2015). This time it was an okay-ish result, but still have not touched redux, webpack and the whole ecosystem.

Soon babel-browser has been marked as obsolete. You can either use babel-standalone or go with webpack/browserify or something like that.
As I already forced myself to use ES6 everywhere I can, i decided to go finally learh webpack.

The concept webpack lies on was already familiar (I did my research and i read blogs everyday), so I just had to play with it a bit. 

Same went with redux. Spent some time watching videos about. Tried it. I still don't like every part of this ecosystem and it probably won't change. But I felt i have to learn this in order to keep up. The frontend community itself forces everyone to keep up.

Well, sooner or later everyone will learn it. It's pretty much do or die, but with the new frameworks coming out every week it gets harder. I mean you can learn [insert a framework/lib name here] every day and you will still have stuff for the next day.

Well, for the conclusion: i won't use TypeScript, thats just too much. :)
