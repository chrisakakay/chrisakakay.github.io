                    For me, web developement always meant more than just a job. Starting with RoR as a full stack opportunity and diving into the frontend javascript mistery drove me to be intrested in javascript even more. <br/><br/>

                    Currently working as a senior frontend developer at EPAM Hungary. We believe in clean and high quality code born on the altar of test driven development.

                    Viveka was born as a proof of concept project and aimed to do better visual regression as the currently existing solutions. <br/><br/>
                    The system was designed around a new layer above the perceptual image differencing, achieving it with DOM analyzation.<br/><br/>

                    However the project is not longer maintained, but the repository is still available
                    <a href="https://github.com/viveka-io/viveka" target="_blank" class="link">here</a>.<br/><br/>

                    BUT, because the concept app was a success (at least in my opinion) I started to remake the project in a different approach and building it as a console tool instead of a website. The project is called Linden and it's available <a href="https://github.com/chrisakakay/linden" target="_blank" class="link">here</a>. I warmly welcome every contributor or anyone who is interested in it.
