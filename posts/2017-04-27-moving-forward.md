# Moving forward

Maybe it's a harsh title, but changing the company i work for is something i consider moving forward.
So I left EPAM Hungary to join Vodafone Shared Services. 

My main motivation behind the change was simple. I wanted to do and learn new things.

And currently this new thing is: React.

Actually i will be able to try out new libs as well (not just React). But thats an other story.
