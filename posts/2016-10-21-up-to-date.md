# Up to date with JavaScript

I decided my first post will not be tech related. I mean it won't contain any code, but the topic is heavily tech related. If you missed the post ["How it feels to learn JavaScript in 2016"](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.ac6oep50c) by [Jose Aguinaga](https://twitter.com/jjperezaguinaga), go and read it's. It's a beautiful post about the struggle of a modern day frontend developer.

I felt myself exactly in the same situation, when in 2015 i tried to make a pet project in my free time and decided to learn something new properly.

First i tried out Angular, started with the standard todo app implementation, but i didn't like it.

Next stop, React. Well, to be honest after i saw JSX, i said NO. Seriously "html" in js? Why?

So i went with jQuery again. It was not that satisfying. I wanted to keep up a but with the current trends. I checked outher libs as well, but nothing was fancy enough to go with it.

Few weeks passed, i started to play with React again with babel-browser (still 2015). This time it was an okay-ish result, but still have not touched redux, webpack and the whole ecosystem.
