        <h1>So you want to be a frontend developer?</h1>
        <p>I will teach you the basics, but be warned this is not be enough to be a fully qualified developer. It will only kickstart your learning process and give you some insights about the tools you HAVE to learn. Consider this as a small lecture.</p>
        <p>We will dive into <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>JavaScript</b> aswell. The HTML + CSS part will be a bit more introductory and the JS part will be a bit more detailed.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-extra">So lets start with HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML is your entry to make a website. For example when you open an url in you browser the standard page will be your <b>index.html</b> which is the main page of a static website. Of course it depends on the server which hosts the website, but this is accurate most of the time. The current version of HTML is 5.</p>
        <p>The HTML file will be parsed by your browser. If it contains CSS or JS file references, the browser will load those too. The HTML will define the structure of your site and you can design it with CSS. You</p>
        <p>This is a basic example: </p>
        <pre><code>
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hello world!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
        </code></pre>
        <p>Try it! Save it as <b>index.html</b> (or anything you want) and open it in your browser. You will see a black "Hello world!" text. It's not much, but still it's progress. :)</p>
        <p>So how does it work?</p>
        <p>In HTML you use <b>tags</b>. Everything (this is not exactly true, there are special cases, but almost everything) has an opening tag and a closing tag with a /. For example: <b>&lt;head&gt;</b> ... <b>&lt;/head&gt;</b></p>
        <p>The basic example in details:</p>
        <pre><code>
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;                       <span>This will tell the browser how to parse your page</span>
    &lt;html&gt;                                <span>Opening html tag</span>
        &lt;head&gt;                            <span>Opening head tag</span>
            &lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;     <span>Page title, browser tabs will show this</span>
        &lt;/head&gt;                           <span>Closing head tag</span>
        &lt;body&gt;                            <span>Opening body tag</span>
            &lt;p&gt;Hello world!&lt;/p&gt;           <span>Simple paragraph</span>
        &lt;/body&gt;                           <span>Closing body tag</span>
    &lt;/html&gt;                               <span>Closing html tag</span>
        </code></pre>
        <p>You can (and should) use self closing tags aswell, but not every tag can be used as a self closing tag. <br/>Consider these: <b>&lt;img src="" /&gt;</b> In this case the image itself is not containing any other tag (at it never will) so it is a self closing tag. But a DIV is a container element and even if its not containing any other tag, it can not be used as a self closing tag.</p>
        <p>In the example almost all tags are needed, except the P with the "Hello world!" text. The HTML tag should contain the head and the body. The head can contain references to CSS and JS files, this way the browser will load these first.</p>
        <p>NOTE: JS files should not be included in the head, because they will block the rendering chain, but the CSS files should be so when the browser renders our page we will have the styles for the rendering. References can be included in the body aswell, JS references should be included at the end of the body, just before the body closing tag.</p>
        <p>The head won't be rendered in any way, but the body will, so thats where we put our nasty stuff.</p>
        <p>Let's see a bit complex example (just kidding, this will be a small one):</p>
        <pre><code>
    ...
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p id="hello" class="blue" style="color: blue"&gt;Hello world!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;a href="www.google.com" target="_blank"&gt;I am a link&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;div class="greeen"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I am a fronted developer now!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
    ...
        </code></pre>
    </body>
